Let‚Äôs walk step by step through how to analyze IMDb movie data and create interactive dashboards for
üëâ Top Movies by Genre, Rating, Picture Quality, OTT Platform, and Cinema Sales Collection.

‚öôÔ∏è Step 1: Import libraries

We'll use:

requests to download data

gzip + pandas to read IMDb .tsv.gz files

plotly.express for interactive charts

numpy for numeric work


import requests
import gzip
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import plotly.express as px
‚úÖ Summary Table

Library          ||	Purpose	                       ||Why Needed

requests	         Fetch online data	               To download datasets or APIs
gzip	             Handle compressed files	         To read .gz data files
pandas	           Data analysis	                   To structure and analyze tabular data
numpy	             Math & array operations	         For fast numerical computations
plotly.express	   Visualization	                   To create interactive charts



---

üì• Step 2: Download IMDb datasets

IMDb provides multiple datasets ‚Äî we‚Äôll use:

title.basics.tsv.gz ‚Üí movie titles, genres, year

title.ratings.tsv.gz ‚Üí IMDb ratings

(optional mock data) for OTT platform & Cinema sales


# Download IMDb basics and ratings datasets
urls = {
    "basics": "https://datasets.imdbws.com/title.basics.tsv.gz",
    "ratings": "https://datasets.imdbws.com/title.ratings.tsv.gz"
}

for name, url in urls.items():
    response = requests.get(url)
    with open(f"{name}.tsv.gz", "wb") as f:
        f.write(response.content)
    print(f"{name} dataset downloaded successfully!")


---

üìÇ Step 3: Load and merge datasets

# Load TSV.GZ files directly into pandas
basics = pd.read_csv("basics.tsv.gz", sep='\t', compression='gzip', low_memory=False)
ratings = pd.read_csv("ratings.tsv.gz", sep='\t', compression='gzip', low_memory=False)

# Keep only movies
movies = basics[basics["titleType"] == "movie"]

# Merge with ratings
movies = pd.merge(movies, ratings, on="tconst", how="inner")

# Clean data
movies = movies.dropna(subset=["primaryTitle", "genres", "averageRating"])
movies = movies[movies["averageRating"] > 0]


---

üé≠ Step 4: Handle multiple genres properly

# Split multiple genres into rows
movies["genres"] = movies["genres"].str.split(",")
movies = movies.explode("genres")
movies = movies[movies["genres"] != "\\N"]  # remove missing genres


---

üèÜ Step 5: Find top movies by genre & rating

# Filter movies with at least 1000 votes to avoid low-sample bias
filtered = movies[movies["numVotes"] >= 1000]

top_movies = (
    filtered.groupby("genres", group_keys=False)
    .apply(lambda x: x.sort_values(by="averageRating", ascending=False).head(10))
    .reset_index(drop=True)
)

print(top_movies[["primaryTitle", "genres", "averageRating", "numVotes"]].head(15))


---

üé® Step 6: Add mock OTT & Picture Quality data

IMDb doesn‚Äôt include OTT or quality fields,
so we‚Äôll simulate them for demo purposes.

np.random.seed(42)
platforms = ["Netflix", "Amazon Prime", "Disney+", "Hulu", "Theatre Only"]
qualities = ["SD", "HD", "Full HD", "4K"]

movies["OTT_Platform"] = np.random.choice(platforms, len(movies))
movies["Picture_Quality"] = np.random.choice(qualities, len(movies))
movies["Cinema_Collection"] = np.random.randint(1, 500, len(movies)) * 1e6  # in $


---

üìä Step 7: Create Interactive Plotly Dashboards

1Ô∏è‚É£ Top Movies by Genre

fig1 = px.bar(
    top_movies,
    x="averageRating",
    y="primaryTitle",
    color="genres",
    orientation="h",
    title="üé¨ Top Movies by Genre & Rating (IMDb)",
    hover_data=["numVotes"]
)
fig1.show()


---

2Ô∏è‚É£ Average Rating by Picture Quality

fig2 = px.box(
    movies,
    x="Picture_Quality",
    y="averageRating",
    color="Picture_Quality",
    title="üé• Average IMDb Rating by Picture Quality"
)
fig2.show()


---

3Ô∏è‚É£ OTT Platform Popularity

ott_avg = movies.groupby("OTT_Platform")["averageRating"].mean().reset_index()

fig3 = px.pie(
    ott_avg,
    names="OTT_Platform",
    values="averageRating",
    title="üì∫ Average Ratings by OTT Platform"
)
fig3.show()


---

4Ô∏è‚É£ Cinema Sales vs Rating

fig4 = px.scatter(
    movies,
    x="averageRating",
    y="Cinema_Collection",
    color="OTT_Platform",
    size="numVotes",
    hover_name="primaryTitle",
    title="üí∞ Cinema Sales Collection vs IMDb Rating"
)
fig4.show()


---

üß† Step 8: Insights You Can Draw

Genres with highest average ratings (e.g., Drama, Biography, Crime).

Which OTTs have higher-rated titles.

Whether 4K movies tend to have higher ratings.

How cinema collections correlate with IMDb ratings.
